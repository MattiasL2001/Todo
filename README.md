📋 My Todo Project

Welcome to my Todo 2.0 project! Why is it called 2.0 you may ask? Well that's because I beefed it up a bit! This Todo app comes with login authentication/authorization
and JSON Web Tokens.
It is built with a React/TypeScript frontend and a ASP.Net Core Web Api/Entity Framework/SQLite backend.
